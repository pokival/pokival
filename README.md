## Skills
- Iteration and recursion
- Modifying arrays
- Making variables
- Attempting to code 

### Classes
So far, I've taken/taking COMP 110, 210, and 290 at UNC! I've learned the basics of Python and am currently analyzing data structures in Java. I'm also getting familiar with Shell, Git, and Docker to help me understand the tools that are available
